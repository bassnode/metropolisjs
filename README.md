MetropolisJS
============

Javascript audio sequencer heavily influenced by Intellijel's [Metropolis](http://www.intellijel.com/eurorack-modules/metropolis/) sequencer module for Eurorack.

Running
============
Currently under a lot of development and fairly basic but it should
work!  To give it a test run:

```
# Install Bower
npm install bower -g

# Install JS dependencies
bower install

# Run a simple web server** and navigate to the root page:
http://localhost:8000

# Chrome or Firefox recommended
```

**[Simple Python web server](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.functions#L97-L104).
