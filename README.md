MetropolisJS
============

Javascript audio sequencer heavily influenced by Intellijel's [Metropolis](http://www.intellijel.com/eurorack-modules/metropolis/) sequencer module for Eurorack.

Running
============
Currently under a lot of development and fairly basic but it works
well under Chrome (not in Firefox)!  To give it a test run:

```
# Install Bower
npm install bower -g

# Install JS dependencies
bower install

# Run a simple web server** and navigate to the root page:
http://localhost:8000

```
